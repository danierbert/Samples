      <h1><b><del>THE BOY WHO SOLD THE<del> BUTTER</b></h1>
      <h2><i><small>A STORY FROM Denmark</small></i></h2>
      <p>There was once a <strong>woman</strong> who had a <em>noodlehead</em> for a son. When
he helped with the chores on the farm, he usually made a mess of
things, so she found it easier to do most of the <sup>work</sup> herself.
<br></br>
One morning, she churned a big pot of sweet butter that she
planned to <sub>sell</sub> in town. Her son begged, "Mother, please let me take
the butter to town to <sub>sell</sub>."
<br></br>
"No," said his mother. "You've never even been to town. It's <mark>big</mark>, and
you'll get lost. Stay home and keep the cow company." But he pleaded
with her for so long that she finally agreed. She gave him some advice
on how to sell the <ins>butter</ins>, and off he went.
<br></br>
He followed the road just as his
mother had told him. After what
seemed like a very long time,
he came upon an enormous
rock. He thought, "My mother
said the town was big. This
certainly is big. It must be
the town!" So he said to
the rock, "Town, would
you like to buy some of
my mother's butter"
<br></br>
The rock, of course,
didn't answer. It was
a rock, after all. This
didn't stop the boy. He
went right on talking.
He was a noodlehead,
after all.</p>
